# PokemonClone
Making my own Pokemon Game from scratch (Java)

# Intro
I just wanted to see how game dev / game design looked like, so I decided to make my own Pokemon Game.
Everything is based from the gen 2-3 games, for example stats and damage dealt are based on the gen 2-3 equations.

# The goal
First goal : making a playable command-line based Pokemon game with random pokemon generation, playable maps that can be easily change and effective battles.
Second goal : make is prettier (Java FX probably)
Third goal : Implement scenario
